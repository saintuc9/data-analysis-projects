# Data Analysis of Car Sales (with Python & Jupyter)
This project analyzes monthly car sales data using Python and provides insights into customer behavior, pricing, and overall sales trends. 
The analysis is conducted in Jupyter Notebook using libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **jupyter notebook**.

## Objective

To understand car sales patterns over a 6-month period (January–June 2024) by analyzing:
- Monthly sales volume
- Average sale price per model
- Revenue per customer
- Customer and model performance
  
## Key Visualizations & Insights

- Monthly Sales (Bar Chart)
- Average Sale Price by Model
- Revenue by Customer
- Sales Distribution (Pie Chart)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn- Jupyter Notebook

- **Insights:**
- **February 2024** recorded the highest number of sales (~20 units).
- **May 2024** saw a drop in sales (~14 units), possibly due to seasonal or external factors.
- **June 2024** showed a partial recovery.
- The sales trend fluctuates month to month, with no consistent growth or decline.

  
## Conclusion
- Sales by Model: (Toyota Camry and Tesla Model) consistently outperform others, suggesting strong customer preference or better marketing.
- Monthly Sales Trend: The line chart and bar chart of monthly sales revealed key patterns, such as peak sales in certain months. This could align with promotional
  campaigns, seasonal buying behavior, or product releases.
- Revenue Insights: The revenue analysis by customer highlights customer generating the most income, which can guide future strategy.
- Sales Distribution: The pie chart offered a clear view of how sales are distributed across different models, helping identify underperforming categories.
